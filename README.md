rss2phpbb
=========

This is a older project that attempted to import rss feed content into phpBB. I'm not sure if it works and no longer support it. Am supporting pull requests. 



## INSTALLATION

1. set folder /rss2mysql/ into your forum directory. (rename or password protect for security!)
2. point your browser to www.site.com/forum/rss2mysql 
3. Fill out details and save. 
4. Set your cronjob on the file www.site.com/forum/rss2mysql/cron_file.php ( use cronwatch.com if needed).


##ADDITIONAL NOTES
* RSS2PHPBB3 is designed to autopost content from an rss feed into a specific forum. 
* Script can only be used by forum owner.
* This script is old and no longer supported and was one of my first development projects
* You are welcome to create issues and merge requests.
